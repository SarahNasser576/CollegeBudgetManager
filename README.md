Explanation of my program and how to use it: \
This program plays a simulation in which the user takes the role of a college freshman who has to manage their semesterly budget while also paying for their needs and wants. The objective of this program is to help college students better understand how to manage a budget. This simulation contains many prompts or situations that college students commonly encounter, such as being pressured to buy designer clothes, buying groceries, making plans for Halloween, having fun on Black Friday, and buying gifts for friends in addition to bathroom supplies. For each situation, the user will enter input for numerous questions, for example if the program asks the user whether they want to buy a new phone. In order to win this simulation or game, you need to make it to the end of the semester while having a non-negative budget. You will lose the game if at some point, your budget becomes negative, or if your budget becomes zero before the end of the semester. All instructions are enclosed in the simulation once you run it.
